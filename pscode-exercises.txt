// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

get number1, number2
return number1 + number2

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

get number
if (number % 2) == 0:
	return "Even"
else:
	return "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

get numbers A, B, C, D, E
average = (A+B+C+D+E)/5

minimum = 0
maximum = 0

for each number in (A, B, C, D, E):
	if number < minimum:
		minimum = number
	else if number > maximum:
		maximum = number

print "The five numbers being compared are": (A, B, C, D, E)
print "Their average is": average
print "The minimum is": minimum
print "The maximum is": maximum
